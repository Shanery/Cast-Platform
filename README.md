# Running OrientDB Locally
<<<<<<< HEAD
In terminal change directory into orientdb-community-2.2.18/bin/ then run the server.sh.

Note: You can look at how OrientDB works by going to localhost:2480. You can login with root, waffl3c0pt3r

# Running the Website
In terminal change directory into concept. Next run the command php artisan serve.

Now go to localhost:8000 to visit the site! The main site isn't really functioning so head on over to documentation and you should find some interesting stuff!

To figure out what is going on...

Click on the TAGs which will create new view layers. 

Each Layer with go deeper into the concept. At each layer, you can then find the properties which are important to you.

Recommended path:
Click on More Information, View, then Conversion Layer.

What you should see is the different levels of thinking from going from User Goals to a Vue Component.

In the future I want to be able to simply search the level of abstract you want, (eg UI Elements/Vue Components) and then you can see the requirements, then look at the related concepts.

Eg. Just say you go into a new project, and you want to know about a certain feature. You search in features for x. Then you want to know where in the code base this feature is. You simply apply other filters and then you can see where the code is. Then while looking at this code file, you can see the set of problems they faced and what they chose to do in order to solve the problem.

This is a conceptual representation of a code base which you can easily search and understand from any point of view that you choose.


# Understanding how the Cast view concept works
In order to help the user Think, we need a way to present and view the information.

Presentation requires extremely clear and directed control of the viewing experience. As such the viewing experience shall be directed by three fundamental components.

First we will start with a concept. This is a flexible way of representing information from which certain filters can be applied.

Second we will have a view filter, which will depend on the goal (eg. Understanding UX of a UI Element vs understanding data requirements for that same UI element) and user preferences like number of alternatives and view depth.

Third will be UI presentation. The UI will have specific views depending on the User's current task or preference. Large amounts of content, for example, will have the option to be be in readable form, while regular exploration will focus more on the structure of the concepts rather than the content.


View Filters can be created by a user who knows which set of properties they want to look at!!! So imagine that you're a UX person, then you will only see info related to UX. Or if you're a Front-end engineer, you see the set of problems related to front-end and the framework you are using...
